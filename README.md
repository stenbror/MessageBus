# MessageBus
A Very Simple MessageBus written in Minimal API and dotnet 8 for Docker

Build it by 'dotnet build' and run it localy by 'dotnet run'

API Documentation: http://localhost:5020/swagger/index.html after you start it running on your own machine. Make sure you use the correct port number.

To build a docker container and execute it: 'docker run -d -P  $(docker build -q .)'
